Slides for ["Why Build Silly Things in R?"](https://sched.co/1c8zy)

Tuesday July 9, 2024 13:25 - 13:30 CEST
Location: Attersee

Data science is an ever-evolving industry that requires constant upskilling. The pressures to learn the latest tools for project deliverables or to enhance one’s CV can be a hindrance to effective learning. Here, I argue for the need for silliness when developing new R skills. Learning is far more enjoyable and conducive to retention and application when we take away the seriousness of upskilling. I will share my experience in creating {ohwhaley} - a ‘toy’ R package which serves as a tool for learning package development and upskilling new learners. I hope attendees will walk away feeling more light-hearted and empowered to build silly things in R to reinvigorate their curiosity for R knowledge.
